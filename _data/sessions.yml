#    <p><b>WORKSHOP</b></p>
#    <p>This course provides an overview of the low-level Linux features–set-UID programs, capabilities, namespaces, and control groups (v2)–that are used
#    to implement privileged applications and build container, virtualization, and sandboxing technologies. (The course does not cover systems such as
#    Docker and LXC, but participants will gain an an insight into the implementation and operation of such systems.)</p>
#    <p>The primary audience comprises designers and programmers building privileged applications, container applications, and sandboxing applications.
#    Systems administrators who manage such applications will also find the course of benefit. Participants should have some awareness of classical
#    Linux/UNIX concepts such as file descriptors and file I/O, signals, and the process lifecycle (fork(), exec(), wait(), exit()). In addition,
#    participants should have a reading knowledge of the C programming language. (Note, however, that the course exercises do not require writing any programs.)</p>

  description: >
    <p>Join us for an open lightning talks event at the end of the first day of the Core C++ 2023 conference!</p>
    <p>A lightning talk event is an open stage for short talks. It’s an event where you and others get to talk about interesting topics for 5-10 minutes. Serious or funny, thoroughly prepared or mostly improvised, expert speaker or first-timer, conference participant or not - everyone is invited.</p>
    <p><b>We welcome talks that are broadly related to C++ development and to software development in general. Entertaining fast-paced talks are particularly welcome, this is a light-spirited event!</b></p>
    <p><a href="https://forms.gle/2bpePPgYSfs4EHwH7">Submitting the talk</a> before the conference is appreciated but not a must</p>
